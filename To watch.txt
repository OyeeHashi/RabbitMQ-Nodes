My name is Hashim Saleem and I'm currently in my 6th Semester, studing in NUST. I have vast knowledge of using different softwares,languages
and the issues that come with them. I've designed technical documents for them and also the SRS documents. I currently have half year of experience 
in web development and I love to solve issues. Hopefully also assist people.


It will help me in understanding the future clients I'm going to have and how they look at products.
So, itll take care of those things and make it easy in my builds.
